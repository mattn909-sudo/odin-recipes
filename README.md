# odin-recipes

The purpose of this project is to get familiar with the basics of HTML. 
In this project I created 4 different webpages depicting different food recipes. 
This project demonstrates the use of links, images, unordered lists, ordered lists, correct headings, and titles. This is also good practice for using git and working through the code staging of adding and commiting changes.
