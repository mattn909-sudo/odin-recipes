    <h2>How to Cook the Green Chile Chicken Enchilada Casserole</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Prepare pastry: Combine flour, 1.5 teaspoons curry powder, and salt in a bowl. Cut in butter and shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Stir in water until mixture forms a ball.</li>
        <li>Shape dough into a log and cut it into 10 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 6-inch circle (approximately 1/8-inch thick) on a lightly floured surface; set aside.</li>
        <li>To make the beef filling: Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Saut√© onion and diced Scotch bonnet pepper until soft, about 2 minutes. Stir in ground beef; season with 1 teaspoon curry powder, allspice, ground cloves, thyme, pepper, and salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until beef is evenly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Crumble in bouillon cube and stir in 1/2 cup of water and browning sauce until well combined; add bay leaf and simmer until liquid is absorbed. Remove skillet from heat; discard bay leaf and stir in bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>Spoon equal amounts of filling onto each pastry circle.</li>
        <li>Fold over and press edges together, making a half-circle. Use the back of a fork to seal edges, then brush tops with beaten egg. Place pastries on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
